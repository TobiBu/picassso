Derived Arrays
==============

`Picassso` adopts the array system used and developed by `Pynbody` 
which automatically derives one array from others. The idea is that 
this system

  (1) permits analysis code to assume that certain arrays exist --
  whether or not they exist in the file;

  (2) allows arrays to be kept up-to-date when they depend on other
  arrays

We refer the  reader to the extensive documentation of 
`Pynbody <https://pynbody.github.io/pynbody/reference/derived.html>`_ 
on this array system
