[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/picassso/picassso.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/picassso/picassso)

[Picassso](https://github.com/picassso/picassso) is a light-weight, 
machine learning and image analysis framework for galaxy images. 

Written in python, the core tools are accompanied by a library of
publication-level analysis routines. For a quick tour of some of 
the features, have a look at this [IPython notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/picassso/picassso/blob/master/examples/notebooks/picasso_demo.ipynb).

### Getting started 

If you have python with distutils installed and properly configured, you can simply do:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/picassso/picassso
$ cd picassso
$ python setup.py install
$ cd ..
$ python
>>> import picassso
```

If this fails, you may find some more detailed installation
instructions [here](http://picassso.github.io/picassso/installation.html). Once
you have the package installed, you can try out the introductory
[tutorials](http://picassso.github.io/picassso/tutorials/tutorials.html).
The full documentation can be found [here](http://picassso.github.io/picassso/).

### Contributing 

Contributions to this project is highly welcome and helps us to
make *picassso* better! As you develop analysis for your science using picassso, consider making your code available for everyone else to use.
You might do so by creating a [tutorial](http://picassso.github.io/picassso/tutorials/tutorials.html) or [cookbook](http://picassso.github.io/picassso/tutorials/tutorials.html#cookbook-recipes) or simply by adding your code to the relevant sub-module and submitting a pull request (make a fork first -- see https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). 


### Acknowledging the code

If you are using picassso we would appreciate if you acknowledge it by citing the [Astrophysics Source Code Library entry](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/...). Optionally you can also cite the Zenodo DOI for the specific version of picassso that you are using, which may be found [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo...).
